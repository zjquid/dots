# if opacity rule doesn't work!
* open the program that doesn't follow the opacity rules (it's usually firefox)
* open a terminal window next to it
* run the program "xprop" and click on the faulty program
* see what xprop returns, and put that in the opacity rule
* e.g. firefox is sometimes "Firefox", and sometimes "Mozilla Firefox" (gentoo)
